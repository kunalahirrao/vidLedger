# VidLedger
The VidLedger website is developed using HTML and CSS by using the flexbox feature which was introduced as a part of CSS. **Flexbox** is an improvement over floats which is a bit tricky. As after using floats you have to clear them. There is no such issue associated with Flexbox and is comparatively easy. Previously it was necessary to user jQuery for smooth scrolling but now we can do the same using CSS [Referance](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_scroll-behavior.asp) . This website is like a boilerplate for Static website you may modify its contents as per your need. I have developed this website to practice Flexbox.Have a look at it [VidLedger](https://loving-cori-195346.netlify.app)
